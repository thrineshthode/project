twitter sentimental analysis 
This Project is used to train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets.
This project could be used  to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 
Step by Step Procedure:
-->Import libraries and datasets 
-->Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
-->Plot the word cloud
-->Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation
-->Perform data cleaning - remove stop words
-->Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)
-->Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization
-->Train a Naive Bayes Classifier
-->Assess trained model performance
